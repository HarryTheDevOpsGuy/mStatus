## How does it work?

We have integrated this repository with mStatus utility. it will read rule file and will check website status and SSL Certificate status. if anything goes wrong it will notify you instantly.

## Core Features?
1. SSL Certificate Monitoring
    - it allow you to track SSL Certificate expiration and get notification time to time.
2. URL/ Website uptime monitoring
    - Easy to get instant notification if your website goes down.  
3. Multiple notification modes (Telegram,Slack,Email,etc)
    - Get notification on multiple platform at same time.  
4. Free of cost
    - Most of the tool and website charge $10-$30 cost to monitor Website and ssl Certificate. I don't want to spend single penny to monitor my website uptime and ssl certificate. So I have developed this tool in Shell Script and python. We have hosted this tool completely on github. So it's free of cost and it will be forever.
